WASHING MACHINE: A washing machine works on the principle of a fuzzy system,the weight of 
clothes put inside it for wash is uncertain.But based on weight measured by sensors,it 
decides time and water levels which can be changed by menus given on the machine control area.

For low water level,time estimate is 25 minutes,where approximate weight is 2000 gms or any 
non-zero positive number below that.
For medium water level,time estimated is 35 minutes,where approximate weight is between 
2001 gms to 4000 gms.
For high water level,time estimated is 45 minutes,where approximate weight is above 4000 gms.
Assume the capacity of the machine is maximum 7000 gms.
Where the approximate weight is zero,the time estimate is 0 minutes.
Write the function which takes numeric weight in the range [0,7000]as input and produces
estimated time as output;if input is more than 7000 then output is "OVERLOADED!"and for all 
other inputs,the output statment is "INVALID INPUT".

Weight                Time 
0 --------------->   0 min
0-2000 ---------->   25 min 
2001-4000-------->   35 min 
4001-7000-------->   45 min
>7000 ----------->   OVERLOAD
